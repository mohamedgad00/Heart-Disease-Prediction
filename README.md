# Heart Disease Prediction using SVM and PCA
  This project predicts whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease using machine learning. It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for 
  dimensionality reduction to compare model performance with and without feature reduction.
