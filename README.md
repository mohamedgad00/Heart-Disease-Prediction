# Heart Disease Prediction using SVM and PCA ❤️
  This project predicts whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease using machine learning. It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, along with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for 
  dimensionality reduction to compare model performance with and without feature reduction.

# 📂 Dataset
  The dataset used is heart.csv, a common dataset for cardiovascular disease prediction. It contains 13 features related to patient health and a binary target variable indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of heart   disease.
